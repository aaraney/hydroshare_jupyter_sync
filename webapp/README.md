# Web app GUI

This app is a React web app written in TypeScript and styled using SCSS.

# Setup

Running this code requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.0 or above. (We recommend using
[n](https://github.com/tj/n) for Node version management.)

Once you have installed Node, run the following:

```bash
cd webapp
yarn install
```

This will install all of the Node packages needed to build the app.

# Running

## Development

To run the code in a development mode (with hot reloading and source maps), run:

### `yarn start`

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Production

Running

### `yarn build`

builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
