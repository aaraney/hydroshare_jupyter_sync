# Hydroshare Jupyter GUI Server Extension

## Setup Instructions

1. From the backend folder run the following commands:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`sudo python setup.py install`

2. Install Node and then run the following command from the webapp folder:
`yarn install`

3. Install Jupyter and generate a config file by running this command:
`jupyter notebook --generate-config`

4. Modify the Jupyter config file:
`sudo gedit ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`
Find the line that starts with: `c.NotebookApp.nbserver_extensions =`.
Uncomment that line and change it to read as follows:
`c.NotebookApp.nbserver_extensions = {'backend.hydroshare_gui': True}`.

5. Add the backend folder of this repository to your PYTHONPATH:
`sudo gedit ~/.bashrc`
Add the following line (modify the path to be the path to this folder/backend):
`export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/username/hydroshare-jupyter-gui/backend"`
Double check that your path has been properly added to by running:
`echo $PYTHONPATH`
and confirming that you see the path to the backend folder.

6. Run `jupyter notebook` in the main hydroshare-jupyter-gui folder to launch
the jupyter server extension. And navigate to localhost:8080 at your browser
to view the webpage.
