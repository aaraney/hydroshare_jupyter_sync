# Hydroshare Jupyter GUI Server Extension

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to hydroshare-jupyter-gui/backend and run these in the command line:

`python setup.py install`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then navigate to hydroshare-jupyter-gui/webapp and run the following in the command line:

`yarn install`

`yarn build`


4. To install jupyter notebook, run the following:

`pip install notebook`

5. Next, you'll need to generate the jupyter config file. You can do this by running this command:

`jupyter notebook --generate-config`

Now, you will need to modify the jupyter config file. You can do this by opening it with your editor of choice (here I use gedit):

`gedit ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`

Find the line that begins with `#c.NotebookApp.nbserver_extensions` and change it to `c.NotebookApp.nbserver_extensions = {'backend.hydroshare_jupyter_sync_pkg': True}`

6. Navigate back to the hydroshare_jupyter_gui folder and run the following:

[//]: # (TODO: make this persistent)

`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/backend`

`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)`

7. Set the path of the folder where your JupyterHub files live on your computer by setting the JH_FOLDER_PATH environment variable. If you are on Ubuntu, you can do this by opening up your `/etc/environment` file and adding the following line:

`JH_FOLDER_PATH="/home/user/my_jh_files"`

Of course, replace "/home/user/my_jh_files" with the path to your JupyterHub files folder. To make sure this path takes effect, you should then log out and log back in (or restart your machine).


8. Now run:

`jupyter notebook`

This will prompt you for your HydroShare username and password. Once entered correctly, you should see a message in the terminal that says "CUAHSI module enabled!"

9. In your web browser, go to localhost:8080 and view the beautiful GUI!
